<a name="policies"></a><h2>Course Policies</h2>
    
<p> Please consult the <a href="Syllabus/Ma3135-Numbers-S17.pdf">Course Syllabus</a> for a more detailed description. 
</p>    


<p><h4>Prerequisites</h4>
High-school algebra and geometry is required; high-school trigonometry is recommended. Though curiosity and desire to learn are far more important.

<p><h4>Hand-in Homework</h4>
There will be homework assignments consisting of various types of problems or tasks. Some might be straight-forward calculations, others might me short-essays and free-response.  You are encouraged to work with other students in solving the homework problems, but you should write your own solutions, and you must acknowledge anyone that you work with.  Your solutions should be written clearly and in complete sentences, with enough detail that another student in the class would be able to follow your reasoning.

<p><h4>What is this class?</h4>

Have you ever wondered what constitutes numbers? Are they real or imagined? Did we discover or create them? What is innity? These fundamental questions have been an inexhaustible source of inspiration to countless thinkers, poets and artists. We will begin our story in 30,000 B.C., about 27,000 years before the dawn of civilization, with primitive forms of counting. We will then jump forward to the fertile crescent region to study the various forms of number systems and symbols of the ancient Babylonians, Egyptians and Greeks. We‚Äôll continue with a study of arithmetic using whole numbers (1,2,...), rational numbers (fractions) and the algebra and geometry associated to them from various viewpoints from antiquity to modernity. Along the way, we‚Äôll learn the story of ‚Äú0‚Äù and why the Pythagoreans would kill to defend the secret of the discovery that &radic;2 was not
a (rational) number! We‚Äôll explore how the ‚Äúreal numbers‚Äù are innitely complex and how the ‚Äúcomplex numbers‚Äù are just as real as any other mathematical object. In the second part of the course, we‚Äôll begin a cultural study of innity where we‚Äôll puzzle over numerous paradoxes and learn that, in fact, modern mathematicians are perfectly comfortable with the idea that there isn‚Äôt just one innity. Time permitting, and according to the tastes and wishes of the class, we can discuss how to logically and rigorously construct the natural numbers and prove theorems such as: 1+1=2. By the end of our course, we will have caught up to the current perspectives on the concept of numbers and learn that this narrative is far from over.</br></br>

Above all, the search for an answer to ‚Äúwhat are numbers?‚Äù is a good story about humanity. And you‚Äôll be an active participant. Not only will we learn from various sources of reading materials, but we will actively explore and ‚Äúplay‚Äù with various problems for ourselves and (re-) discover many gems of insight in seminar and assignments. Conference work will be allocated to clarifying course ideas and exploring additional mathematical or philosophical topics.
</p>

<a name="policies"></a><h2>Thematic Outline</h2>

<h4>Part 0: Pre-History &amp; Number Sense</h4>

How far back does the story go? Can animals count? &amp; more.

<h4>Part 1: Ancient Number Systems</h4>

We‚Äôll learn how to count and express numbers in ancient Egyptian, Babylolian, and Summarian number
systems. The goal here is to be procient enough so that if we traveled back in time to these civilizations, we‚Äôd nd work as accountants ;-) </br> </br>
Additional systems will be explored in the assignments and/or conference work.

<h4>Part 2: Abstraction, Part I: From Counting Numbers to <span style="font-style: italic;">Imaginary</span> Numbers</h4>

The Five W‚Äôs of zero, negative numbers, fractions, real and complex numbers. Additional numbers will be explored in the assignments and/or in conference work.

<h4>Part 3: Abstraction, Part II: Towers of Innity</h4>

We‚Äôll discuss innity in detail from multiple perspectives from mathematical, cultural, philosophical, geometric and artistic.

<h4>Part 4: Literary Interlude</h4>

Numbers in literature. We‚Äôll read two stories from my compatriot Jorge Luis Borges‚Äô plus any additional works suggested by the class. 

</br>

<h4>Part <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>: Abstraction, Part III: Building Number Systems Rigorously</h4>

If time permits, and according to class wishes, we can study how to mathematically construct the counting numbers, {1, 2, 3, . . .}, and prove some theorems.
