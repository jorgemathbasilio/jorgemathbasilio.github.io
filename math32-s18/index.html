<h4>Cheat Sheets for Final Exam</h4>  
    

<p>I forgot to mention this in class this morning, but&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><strong>I will allow a cheat sheet on the final exam </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong>under certain rules.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

    <p>Please read the document <a href="GoodvsBadCheetSheets.pdf">&quot;GoodvsBad&quot; Cheat Sheets</a>. It was written for a different school but the info obviously is school independent.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The key to making a Good Cheat Sheet (GCS) is that it has to be done <strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">by hand</span> </strong>and well-organized.&nbsp;Printing one out from the internet will not be allowed.</p>

    <p>I will collect your cheat sheets&nbsp;at the beginning of the exam and will check them individually to see if they satisfy the requirements of a GCS. If they pass, it will be returned to you and you can use it for the remained of the text (approximately 15-20 minutes after the exam begins). However, if it&#39;s a bad cheat sheet then I will not return it and you will not be able to use it on the exam.&nbsp; Please follow the following rules/requirements:</p>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR GCS:</strong></span></p>

    <ul>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>Must be </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>hand-written &amp; NEAT &amp;&nbsp;written&nbsp;by YOU</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>SIZE: using a </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>regular 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of white&nbsp;printer paper</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong><strong> </strong></strong><strong>(no other paper allowed, no lined paper, graph paper etc)</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>CHEAT SHEET NOTES&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;ONLY ALLOWED ON ONE&nbsp;SIDE</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong><strong> </strong>of the page</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>The </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>other&nbsp;side</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong> of the page must include: Your name, Course, Instructor, Date </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong><em>and nothing else</em></strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>You may include an </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>unlimited number of</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong> </strong><strong>definitions, theorems, graphs of standard functions, and formulas</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>You are allowed to have</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>AT MOST TWO example problems with complete solutions</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>. </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong>These must be clearly indicated with a box around them&nbsp;so that I can find them and check that no more than two worked out problems are on your cheat sheet.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>Must follow the principles outlined in the GCSvsBCS document discussed in class and available on Sakai</strong></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);">This is completely subjective and up to my discretion</span></li>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);">If I don&#39;t think you followed the spirit of the document or if you failed to follow any of the above&nbsp;directions then I reserve the right to not&nbsp;allow you to use your cheat sheet</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(238,130,238);"><strong>***BONUS***&nbsp;if your cheat sheet is </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(64,224,208);"><strong>beautiful<strong> </strong>&amp; complete</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(238,130,238);"><strong> (meaning it has the <em>main</em> ideas from all the chapters we covered) you can earn 3% extra credit on your final exam.</strong></span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have any questions, you can email me or ask me during the final exam review session on Friday.</p>

<h4>Final Exam Review</h4>  
    
    <p>
    I noticed that Friday is a designated reading day so there will not be office hours on Friday morning.</p>

    Instead, we will have an optional final exam review session on Friday from 2-4 pm. Just find us in our of the classrooms near my office. 
    
    
<h4>Exam 3 &mdash; Take-Home Instructions</h4>    
    
<p>Here is <a href="Ma32-CalcIII-Exam3-S18.pdf">Exam 3</a>. <strong><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">DUE:</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">Monday at 5pm</span> <span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);">in my office (Avery 220).</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(128,0,128);"><strong>&gt;&gt;Directions:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><em><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Once you open/download/print the exam, you are not allowed to consult any textbook, notes, other people, or the internet.&nbsp;</span></em></li>
	<li>You must work entirely on your own! No tutors, working with classmates, using the textbook, online sources, or other outside help. Students suspected of cheating will be given a zero for this exam and reported to the appropriate office.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">Please print this exam and write your answers in the space provided.</span> All work must be shown to receive credit. You may chose to do some scratch work on another page, but be sure to write any relevant calculations on your printed exam copy.</li>
	<li>Include:
	<ul>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">a cover page (including: title, your name, course, my name, date due), </span></li>
		<li><s><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">write on the front side of each page only,</span></s><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">&nbsp;[removed: doesn&#39;t make sense since you&#39;ll print and write on the exam directly]</span></li>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);">staple your work.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>No calculator is allowed on this exam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck!</p>


<p><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>PS. I will be traveling all day and will not be able to check my email until the evening (hopefully by 6pm or so). Just keep that in mind if you email me questions. I will be happy to reply and answer questions when I have internet access again.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
   

<h4>Exam 2 Extra Credit</h4>
    
    For our second exam, instead of test corrections I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to retake the exam to increase your grade. 

    <p></p>If you would like to retake the exam, please email me to schedule a date and time (during regular office hours would be preferable).</p>

    <p>This will not be done during the regular class time.</p>

    More details:

    <ul>
        <li>It will be exactly the same exam as Exam 2</li>
        <li>You will have 50 minutes to complete it (instead of 60)</li>
        <li>No calculators, show work, and the same test directions as usual.</li>
        <li>I will be grading it a bit tougher than the first time (because it's a retake and you'll have an opportunity to study from it and also read my comments). In particular, if you didn't simplify all the way on the exam but got full credit on the retake you might not get full credit. Why? Because I would like this to be a learning opportunity.</li>
        <li><b>How it will change your score:</b> I will take the average of your two scores.</li>
        <li>If you perform worse on Exam 2 then it WILL NOT negatively effect your grade, and we'll keep the first score only.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please email me. Have a nice weekend.</li>
    </ul>
 

<h4>Exam 2 Extra Credit</h4>
    
    There is an opportunity to increase your Exam 2 score by doing "test corrections:"

    <p>Instructions for Test Corrections:</p>    
    
    <ul>
    <li>Due: Wednesday, April 11 (in-class).</li>
    <li>Write test solutions to every question. Your work can contain at most one incorrect solution. More than that and you will not qualify for extra credit.
        <ul>
        <li>If your score was 94 or higher, then you only have to redo the problems where you missed points (but the problem needs to be re-done from beginning to end). </li>
        <li>For True/False questions, on the test corrections please include a brief justification with your answer. On the test, you don't need any justifications but for the test corrections I would like to see them.</li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Follow the same directions as for Exam 1 extra-credit</li>
    </ul>
    
Students who meet the above requirements will have their Exam 1 scores improved according to the following formula:
    
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b><span style="color:blue">New grade = [Exam 2 score] + 35 &#37; * [110 - Exam 2 score]
    </span></b> (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
    </li>
    </ul>
    
Example: Exam 1 score is 70. Then after extra credit the new score is 70+35 &#37;*[40] = 84.   
    
<h4>Exam 1 Extra Credit</h4>
    
    There is an opportunity to increase your Exam 1 score by doing "test corrections:"

    <p>Instructions for Test Corrections:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Due: Wednesday, February 28 (in-class).</li>
    <li>Write test solutions to every question. Your work can contain at most one incorrect solution. More than that and you will not qualify for extra credit.
        <ul>
        <li>If your score was 90 or higher, then you only have to redo the problems where you missed points (but the problem needs to be re-done from beginning to end). </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Must have a cover page (including: title, your name, course, my name, date due)</li>
    <li>Write on the front side of each page only</li>
    <li>Box answers, make sure problems that require units have the correct units, etc</li>
    <li>You must work entirely on your own! No tutors, working with classmates, using the textbook, online sources, or other outside help</li>
    <li>Only help allowed is me. Come to office hours or schedule a meeting. I am more than happy to explain these questions in person!</li>
    </ul>

Students who meet the above requirements will have their Exam 1 scores improved according to the following formula:
    
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b><span style="color:blue">New grade = [Exam 1 score] + 10 &#37; * [100 - Exam 1 score]
    </span></b> (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
    </li>
    </ul>
    
Example: Exam 1 score is 50 (a D). Then after extra credit the new score is 50+10 &#37;*[30] = 53, which is a 66 &#37; which is now in the C range.     

<h4>Exam Preparation</h4>

    I posted the document <i>Math32-CalcIII-Notes.pdf</i> under the hand-outs.</br>

    This document has tons of helpful info to help you prepare for our upcoming exam.</br>

    It explains basic test info, sections covered, notes that summarizes the key points of the sections covered, and at the end it has practice exam problems from the textbook.</br>

    The answers to odd problems are available via the ebook on WebAssign and the even numbered problems are provided in the document itself.</br> 

    Happy studying!    

<h4>Online Graphing Calculator for 3D Plotting</h4>

As I showed in class, <a href="http://web.monroecc.edu/manila/webfiles/pseeburger/CalcPlot3D/">"CalcPlot3D"</a>, is a very useful tool to help you visualize 3D plots of curves, functions etc. 

<p>You can use this on some of the tougher WebAssign questions as an aid. </p>

Hope you find it helpful and straightforward to use :-)

<h4>Math Lunch!</h4> 
    
    This semester the Pitzer Math faculty: Jemma Lorenat, Jim Hoste, and myself</br>
    will be hosting <b><span style="color:orange">MATH LUNCH</span></b> every Monday from 12-1 pm in the dinning room (look for the cheesy hand-written "Math Lunch" sign).</br>
    
    What is <b><span style="color:orange">MATH LUNCH</span></b>?</br>

    It's an informal way to come and chat with us.
    We can talk about math, or not about math….that pretty much covers everything!</br>

    See you there!    
    
<h4>New Office Hours!</h4>   
    
These are my updated hours for this semester:
    <ul style="color:orange">
        <li><b>Monday: 10:30-11:30 am</b></li>
        <li><b>Wednesday: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm</b></li>
        <li><b>Friday: 8-9 am</b></li>
    </ul>

Please update your schedule!     
    
<h4>Office Hours Poll</h4>
    
    Using the google doodle link,  <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/zm2bcpbs7tvrwmh9">https://doodle.com/poll/zm2bcpbs7tvrwmh9</a>, please select ALL the times that fit into your schedule where you can attend office hours.
    </br>
    
    I will select the THREE times that have the largest number of selections at the end of the week and begin holding these hours next week.</br>

    In the meantime, I'm sticking to the hours posted on the Syllabus: MW 10:45-11:45 am, F 11-11:50 am</br>

    Hope this helps :-)
    
<h4>Section Key</h4>
    
Sections marked with a "*" = Optional sections to be read but no RP. Students who plan to take more advanced courses using calculus (e.g. econ, physics) are encouraged to read these.
    
<h4> WebAssign Access and Class Key</h4>
    <p>
    Jan 16 2018</br>
    Here is the "Class Key" to register and access WebAssign, 
    which is the online homework system that we will use.
    <ul class="biglist">
    <li>    
    Class Key: pitzercollege.ca 5915 4397
    </li>
    </ul> 
    Please purchase access to the "homework AND e-book" which is approximately 
    $100 total and is the best deal.</br>
    Sign-up immediately since registration is 
    <b><span style="color:orange">FREE for the first two weeks of class</span></b>.</br>
    Email me with any questions.</br>
    Week 1 will start learning vectors. I will assume you know Calculus I &amp; II so please review this material on your own. It is a good idea to print the review sheets and have them handy in your folder.
    </p>

<a name="policies"></a><h2>Course Policies</h2>
    
<p> Please consult the <a href="Syllabus/Ma32-Calc3-Syllabus-S18.pdf">Course Syllabus</a> for a more detailed description. 
</p>    

<h4>What is this class?</h4>

<p>
This course extends the thread of mathematical inquiry of the dual topics of differentiation and
integration for functions of several variables. Whereas functions of one variable may be visualized as curves on the plane, we may visualize a real-valued function of two-variables as a surface in
three-dimensional space. But what does it mean to take a derivative or a defnite integral of a surface? We will address this question and more in this course. Like in Calculus I &ampp; II, we will see that there is a beautiful geometry associated with functions of several variables.
</p>    

<p>
Our frst task will be to develop a useful language for easily describing geometric objects in two and three dimensions using vectors. Then we will continue to study vector-valued functions, partial derivatives, the gradient vector, Lagrange multipliers, double and triple integrals and line integrals, culminating with the fundamental theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. We will also apply these ideas to a wide range of problems that include motion in space, optimization, arc length, surface area, volumes, and centers of mass, time permitting. 
</p>

<p>
The students should be able to interpret the concepts of Calculus algebraically, graphically and verbally. More generally, the students will improve their ability to think critically, to analyze a problem and solve it using a wide array of tools. These skills will be invaluable to them in whatever path they choose to follow, be it as a mathematics major or in pursuit of a career in one of the other sciences.
</p>

<p><h4>Prerequisites</h4>
Completion of Math 31 (or equivalent experience with college-level Calculus II), a suitable score on the mathematics placement exam, or permission of the instructor.

<p><h4>Online Homework via WebAssign</h4>
Computation is an important component of mathematics, and is a key part of any calculus course.  
I will select problems from the textbook to be done and checked online via the platform WebAssign.  
<!--
<p><h4>Hand-in Homework</h4>
There will be homework assignments consisting of longer problems, with an emphasis on the conceptual side of calculus and it's applications to the sciences.  You are encouraged to work with other students in solving the homework problems, but you should write your own solutions, and you must acknowledge anyone that you work with.  Your solutions should be written clearly and in complete sentences, with enough detail that another student in the class would be able to follow your reasoning.-->
    
<p><h4>Textbook</h4>
The textbook is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1285741552"><i>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</i></a>, 8th Ed., by James Stewart.  We will cover most of the material in Chapters 12 &ndash; 16. You should read the relevant section of the text <i>before</i> we cover the material in class, and then again while doing the homework.<br><br>

The textbook comes with access to the WebAssign system. So if you are ok with studying from an ebook then you DO NOT have to buy a hard copy of the textbook. <!--I would encourage students who plan to take Calc II,III, or more advanced mathematics courses to purchase a hardcopy of the textbook to keep as a reference.--><br><br>

You can buy an earlier edition for cheaper if you plan to use it as a future reference or resource. Since the HW is done online you will not need the textbook for the homework, only to read the book and study.

</p>

<h4>Additional Textbooks and Resources</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx">Paul’s Online Math Notes.</a>

<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>The in-class exams are one hour long, and will take place on   
    
    <ul>
    <li><b>Exam 1. Monday, 2/12/2018</b></li>
    <li><b>Exam 2. Monday, 3/21/2018</b></li>
    <li><b>Exam 3. Friday, 4/30/2018</b></li>
    </ul>
<i>Dates are subject to change.</i> Exams are scheduled during the end of the class period, approximately 60 minutes long. The first 15 minutes will be reserved for Questions and Answers from students.</p> 

<p>The final exam is three hours long, and will be on <b>Monday, May&nbsp;7</b>, in our usual classroom from 2-5 pm.</p>


<p><h4>Calculator</h4>
This is a course of mathematical concepts and techniques, not a course of mechanical computation, so we will have little use for calculators. You may bring a calculator or laptop with you to class if you wish. If you bring a laptop please do not use it to check email or chat with friends, or do any tasks that would disturb your fellow classmates. We will discuss the free programs Desmons, Geogebra, Symbolab, Wolfram Alpha, and SAGE and how it can help in learning. Please note that no calculators of any kind will be allowed during exams.
