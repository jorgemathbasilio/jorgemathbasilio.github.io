<h4>Cheat Sheets for Final Exam</h4>  
    

<p>I forgot to mention this in class this morning, but&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><strong>I will allow a cheat sheet on the final exam </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong>under certain rules.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

    <p>Please read the document <a href="GoodvsBadCheetSheets.pdf">&quot;GoodvsBad&quot; Cheat Sheets</a>. It was written for a different school but the info obviously is school independent.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The key to making a Good Cheat Sheet (GCS) is that it has to be done <strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">by hand</span> </strong>and well-organized.&nbsp;Printing one out from the internet will not be allowed.</p>

    <p>I will collect your cheat sheets&nbsp;at the beginning of the exam and will check them individually to see if they satisfy the requirements of a GCS. If they pass, it will be returned to you and you can use it for the remained of the text (approximately 15-20 minutes after the exam begins). However, if it&#39;s a bad cheat sheet then I will not return it and you will not be able to use it on the exam.&nbsp; Please follow the following rules/requirements:</p>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR GCS:</strong></span></p>

    <ul>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>Must be </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>hand-written &amp; NEAT &amp;&nbsp;written&nbsp;by YOU</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>SIZE: using a </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>regular 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of white&nbsp;printer paper</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong><strong> </strong></strong><strong>(no other paper allowed, no lined paper, graph paper etc)</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>CHEAT SHEET NOTES&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;ONLY ALLOWED ON ONE&nbsp;SIDE</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong><strong> </strong>of the page</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>The </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>other&nbsp;side</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong> of the page must include: Your name, Course, Instructor, Date </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong><em>and nothing else</em></strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>You may include an </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>unlimited number of</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong> </strong><strong>definitions, theorems, graphs of standard functions, and formulas</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>You are allowed to have</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255,140,0);"><strong>AT MOST TWO example problems with complete solutions</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>. </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);"><strong>These must be clearly indicated with a box around them&nbsp;so that I can find them and check that no more than two worked out problems are on your cheat sheet.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,205);"><strong>Must follow the principles outlined in the GCSvsBCS document discussed in class and available on Sakai</strong></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);">This is completely subjective and up to my discretion</span></li>
		<li><span style="color: rgb(165,42,42);">If I don&#39;t think you followed the spirit of the document or if you failed to follow any of the above&nbsp;directions then I reserve the right to not&nbsp;allow you to use your cheat sheet</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(238,130,238);"><strong>***BONUS***&nbsp;if your cheat sheet is </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(64,224,208);"><strong>beautiful<strong> </strong>&amp; complete</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(238,130,238);"><strong> (meaning it has the <em>main</em> ideas from all the chapters we covered) you can earn 3% extra credit on your final exam.</strong></span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(47,79,79);"><strong>If you have any questions, you can email me or ask me during the final exam review session on Friday.</strong></span></p>

    
<h4>Exam 2 Review Session</h4>    
    
    I will hold an optional review for Exam 3 Wednesday 3:30-4:15pm, we'll be in one of the classrooms near my office.    

<h4>Exam 2 Extra Credit</h4>
    
    For our second exam, instead of test corrections I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to retake the exam to increase your grade. 

    <p></p>If you would like to retake the exam, please email me to schedule a date and time (during regular office hours would be preferable).</p>

    <p>This will not be done during the regular class time.</p>

    More details:

    <ul>
        <li>It will be exactly the same exam as Exam 2</li>
        <li>You will have 50 minutes to complete it (instead of 60)</li>
        <li>No calculators, show work, and the same test directions as usual.</li>
        <li>I will be grading it a bit tougher than the first time (because it's a retake and you'll have an opportunity to study from it and also read my comments). In particular, if you didn't simplify all the way on the exam but got full credit on the retake you might not get full credit. Why? Because I would like this to be a learning opportunity.</li>
        <li><b>How it will change your score:</b> I will take the average of your two scores.</li>
        <li>If you perform worse on Exam 2 then it WILL NOT negatively effect your grade, and we'll keep the first score only.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please email me. Have a nice weekend.</li>
    </ul>
 
<h4>Exam 2 Study Guide Errata</h4>
    
    There's a few questions that you should ignore since they involve functions that we didn't study. These are:

    <p>hyperbolic trig functions like sinh(x), cosh(x), etc and their inverses like sinh^(-1)(x), etc</p>

    The problems to ignore are: Concept check: 2 o-t.

    <p>Thanks to Gabriella for bringing this to my attention.</p>
    
<h4>Exam 1 Extra Credit</h4>
    
    There is an opportunity to increase your Exam 1 score by doing "test corrections:"

    <p>Instructions for Test Corrections:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Due: Friday, February 23 (in-class).</li>
    <li>Write test solutions to every question. Your work can contain at most one incorrect solution. More than that and you will not qualify for extra credit.
        <ul>
        <li>If your score was 85 or higher, then you only have to redo the problems where you missed points (but the problem needs to be re-done from beginning to end). </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Must have a cover page (including: title, your name, course, my name, date due)</li>
    <li>Write on the front side of each page only</li>
    <li>Box answers, make sure problems that require units have the correct units, etc</li>
    <li>You must work entirely on your own! No tutors, working with classmates, using the textbook, online sources, or other outside help</li>
    <li>Only help allowed is me. Come to office hours or schedule a meeting. I am more than happy to explain these questions in person!</li>
    </ul>

Students who meet the above requirements will have their Exam 1 scores improved according to the following formula:
    
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b><span style="color:blue">New grade = [Exam 1 score] + 20% * [100 - Exam 1 score]
    </span></b> (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
    </li>
    </ul>

Example: Exam 1 score is 73 (approximately a C). Then after extra credit the new score is 73+20%*[27] = 73+5.4=78.4, rounded up it becomes 79 (approximately B-).    

<h4>Exam Preparation</h4>

    I posted the document <i>Math30-CalcI-Notes.pdf</i> under the hand-outs.</br>

    This document has tons of helpful info to help you prepare for our upcoming exam.</br>

    It explains basic test info, sections covered, notes that summarizes the key points of the sections covered, and at the end it has practice exam problems from the textbook.</br>

    The answers to odd problems are available via the ebook on WebAssign and the even numbered problems are provided in the document itself.</br> 

    Happy studying!    
    
<h4>Math Lunch!</h4> 
    
    This semester the Pitzer Math faculty: Jemma Lorenat, Jim Hoste, and myself</br>
    will be hosting <b><span style="color:orange">MATH LUNCH</span></b> every Monday from 12-1 pm in the dinning room (look for the cheesy hand-written "Math Lunch" sign).</br>
    
    What is <b><span style="color:orange">MATH LUNCH</span></b>?</br>

    It's an informal way to come and chat with us.
    We can talk about math, or not about math….that pretty much covers everything!</br>

    See you there!    
    
<h4>New Office Hours!</h4>   
    
These are my updated hours for this semester:
    <ul style="color:orange">
        <li><b>Monday: 10:30-11:30 am</b></li>
        <li><b>Wednesday: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm</b></li>
        <li><b>Friday: 8-9 am</b></li>
    </ul>

Please update your schedule!     
    
<h4>Office Hours Poll</h4>
    
    Using the google doodle link,  <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/zm2bcpbs7tvrwmh9">https://doodle.com/poll/zm2bcpbs7tvrwmh9</a>, please select ALL the times that fit into your schedule where you can attend office hours.
    </br>
    
    I will select the THREE times that have the largest number of selections at the end of the week and begin holding these hours next week.</br>

    In the meantime, I'm sticking to the hours posted on the Syllabus: MW 10:45-11:45 am, F 11-11:50 am</br>

    Hope this helps :-)
    
<h4>Section Key</h4>
    
Sections marked with a "*" = Optional sections to be read but no RP. Students who plan to take more advanced courses using calculus (e.g. econ, physics) are encouraged to read these.
    
<h4> WebAssign Access and Class Key</h4>
    <p>
    Jan 16 2018</br>
    Here is the "Class Key" to register and access WebAssign, 
    which is the online homework system that we will use.
    <ul class="biglist">
    <li>    
    Class Key: pitzercollege.ca 0142 6808
    </li>
    </ul> 
    Please purchase access to the "homework AND e-book" which is approximately 
    $100 total and is the best deal.</br>
    Sign-up immediately since registration is 
    <b><span style="color:orange">FREE for the first two weeks of class</span></b>.</br>
    Email me with any questions.</br>
    Week 1 will be review some important precalculus notions from the textbook: 1.1 &mdash; 1.3. 
    If you haven't taken precalculus recently at the college level please review these.</br>
    Alternatively, study the review/cheat sheets I posted.</br>
    I'll try to have an extra "review" period outside of class to help students. More info on this later.
    </p>

<a name="policies"></a><h2>Course Policies</h2>
    
<p> Please consult the <a href="Syllabus/Ma30-Calc1-Syllabus-S18.pdf">Course Syllabus</a> for a more detailed description. 
</p>    

<p><h4>What is this class?</h4>
    
Our existence lies in a perpetual state of change. An apple falls from a tree, clouds move across expansive farmland blocking out the sun for days, meanwhile satellites zip around the Earth transmitting and receiving signals to our cell phones. The calculus was invented to develop a language to accurately describe and study the change we see. The ancient Greeks began a detailed study of change but they were scared to wrestle with the infinite and so it was not until the 17th century that maverick mathematicians, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, among others, tamed infinity and gave birth to an extremely successful branch of mathematics called <i>the Calculus</i>. Though just a few hundred years old, the Calculus has become an indispensable research tool in both the natural, social sciences and Economics and Buisness.</br></br>

The power of calculus lies in its power to reduce complicated problems to simple rules and procedures. While these procedures can be (and often are) taught with little regard to the underlying mathematical concepts or their practical uses, our emphasis will be on understanding all of these: concepts, procedures and uses. We will engage in the full mathematical process, which includes searching for patterns, order and reason; creating models of real world situations to clarify and predict better what happens around us; understanding and explaining ideas clearly; and applying the mathematics we know to solve unfamiliar problems.
</p>

<p><h4>Prerequisites</h4>
Completion of Math 25 (or equivalent experience with college-level Precalculus), a suitable score on the mathematics placement exam, or permission of the instructor.

<p><h4>Online Homework via WebAssign</h4>
Computation is an important component of mathematics, and is a key part of any calculus course.  
I will select problems from the textbook to be done and checked online via the platform WebAssign.  
<!--
<p><h4>Hand-in Homework</h4>
There will be homework assignments consisting of longer problems, with an emphasis on the conceptual side of calculus and it's applications to the sciences.  You are encouraged to work with other students in solving the homework problems, but you should write your own solutions, and you must acknowledge anyone that you work with.  Your solutions should be written clearly and in complete sentences, with enough detail that another student in the class would be able to follow your reasoning.-->
    
<p><h4>Textbook</h4>
The textbook is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1285741552"><i>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</i></a>, 8th Ed., by James Stewart.  We will cover most of the material in Chapters 1&ndash;5. You should read the relevant section of the text <i>before</i> we cover the material in class, and then again while doing the homework.<br><br>

The textbook comes with access to the WebAssign system. So if you are ok with studying from an ebook then you DO NOT have to buy a hard copy of the textbook. I would encourage students who plan to take Calc II,III, or more advanced mathematics courses to purchase a hardcopy of the textbook to keep as a reference.<br><br>

You can buy an earlier edition for cheaper if you plan to use it as a future reference or resource. Since the HW is done online you will not need the textbook for the homework, only to read the book and study.

</p>

<h4>Additional Textbooks and Resources</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx">Paul’s Online Math Notes.</a>

<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>The in-class exams are one hour long, and will take place on   
    
    <ul>
    <li><b>Exam 1. Monday, 2/12/2018</b></li>
    <li><b>Exam 2. Monday, 3/26/2018</b></li>
    <li><b>Exam 3. Friday, 4/27/2018</b></li>
    </ul>
<i>Dates are subject to change.</i> Exams are scheduled during the end of the class period, approximately 60 minutes long. The first 15 minutes will be reserved for Questions and Answers from students.</p> 

<p>The final exam is three hours long, and will be on <b>Monday, May&nbsp;7</b>, in our usual classroom from 9-12.</p>


<p><h4>Calculator</h4>
This is a course of mathematical concepts and techniques, not a course of mechanical computation, so we will have little use for calculators. You may bring a calculator or laptop with you to class if you wish. If you bring a laptop please do not use it to check email or chat with friends, or do any tasks that would disturb your fellow classmates. We will discuss the free programs Desmons, Geogebra, Symbolab, Wolfram Alpha, and SAGE and how it can help in learning. Please note that no calculators of any kind will be allowed during exams.
