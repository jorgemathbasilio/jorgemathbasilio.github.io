<h4>Introduction to Calculus and Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="CourantJohnPgs1-12.pdf">Courant &amp; John</a></li>
</ul>   

Courant and John pages 1-12 only containing sections 1.1a, 1.1b, and 1.1c.<br><br> 

Cultural context: Introduces the subject of analysis with real variables. It is important to read this since it explains what a 'real number,' and surprisingly enough, and will lay the foundation for more advanced topics in Complex Analysis. 
    
<h4>What is Mathematics?</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="CourantRobbins-What_Is_Mathematics-p20-24.pdf">Courant &amp; Robbins</a></li>
</ul>   

This is the introduction to the excellent book of the same title by Courant &amp; Robbins. In these four little pages you will get a great idea of how modern mathematicians view mathematics. As fresh today as it was in 1941 when it was first published.

<h4>Final Conference Work Submission Instructions</h4>      
It’s that exciting time of the semester where we are almost done and we get to compile our efforts into a final document. To guarantee the final submission looks professional, please follow these instructions. I can’t wait to read your work!</br></br>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>
    <span style="color:blue";>Final Due date: 
    <span style="color:red";>Tuesday, December 20, by 5 pm</span>

    What to submit:<br>
    Cover page<br>
    Table of Contents<br>
    A paragraph (or two) that explains what the conference project was, what we discussed in meetings, and why you chose this topic.<br>
    Main Work (this is your final paper)<br>
    References
    </span>
    </li>
    <li>
    Cover page: Please choose an appropriate title for your conference work. Please have me approve the title before the final submission. This is the title that I will submit in my evaluation. Please also include: Name, Date, Course Number, Course Name, Instructor
    </li>
    <li>
    The "Main Work" might have the same or a different title than the Conference Project.
    </li>
    <li>
    Format: Please write using 12 point font (either Georgia or Arial font), double-spaced, with 1 inch margins. Please include proper citations which you will include in the “References” page but you can follow any of the standard ways to do so (APA, MLA,...).
    </li>
    </ul>

Other notes:<br>

(i) Make sure that the font is the same for the entire document.<br>

(ii) Typing this up using LaTeX is highly recommended, but I decided not to require it.<br> 
    If you want info on LaTeX, see: <a href="http://math.bard.edu/bloch/tex/">Professor Ethan Bloch's LaTeX website</a><br><br>

 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!  

    
<h4>Errata for HHW7</h4>    
There's a few typos spotted on the questions. I'll post them briefly here and when I get back home I'll upload a corrected PDF:</br>

Problem 10(a): the denominator should be \(1+z\) not \(1-z\)
Problem 10(c): Should be \(f_1(f_2(f_3(z))))\).
Problem 7 after part (d), before (e): the formulas for the dot product are incorrect! The correct formulas should read: \(|z||proj_z(w)|\) or \(|w||proj_w(z)|\).
Let me know if you find any other typos!

<a name="policies"></a><h2>Course Policies</h2>
    
<p> Please consult the <a href="Syllabus/Ma3614-Complex-F16.pdf">Course Syllabus</a> for a more detailed description. 
</p>    


<p><h4>Prerequisites</h4>
Successful completion of Calculus II or the equivalent (a score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC AP test) is required; completion of an intermediate-level mathematics course (e.g. Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, or Discrete Mathematics) is recommended.

<p><h4>Hand-in Homework</h4>
There will be homework assignments consisting of various types of problems or tasks. Some might be straight-forward calculations, others might me short-essays and free-response.  You are encouraged to work with other students in solving the homework problems, but you should write your own solutions, and you must acknowledge anyone that you work with.  Your solutions should be written clearly and in complete sentences, with enough detail that another student in the class would be able to follow your reasoning.

A few comments about the required texts.</br>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>
    [CA] will be our main text and we'll cover almost all of it. Students are not required to purchase a physical copy of the book as an electronic version is provided at no additional cost with a purchase of access to WebAssign--Note bene: access to the ebook ends after the semester ends! However, I strongly recommend students buy a physical copy of the textbook.
    </li>
    <li>
    WebAssign access can be purchased directly online (with a credit card) or with the textbook (if bought with the textbook, don't lose this ``key code''!!!)    
    </li>
    <li>
    We will begin the course by reading the first three chapters from "An Imaginary Tale" in the first week of class so be sure to have a copy before the first day of class! A copy will be place on reserve at the library. After the first three chapters, you can read the other chapters for enjoyment in like a day or two after the semester is done or just keep reading it before jumping into the official textbook by Zill &amp; Shanahan. Chapter 4 is really charming and hopefully will get you hooked on the subject. You can skip Ch 5, 6, &amp; 7. If you want to preview the theory of Complex Analysis early, then read/skim chapter 7. Let anything tricky wash over you ;-)
    </li>
    <li>
    I will provide selections from [VCA] via MySLC. A copy will be placed on reserve at the library so I recommend you skim through it at the library first. If you fall in love, by all means, buy it and maybe study from it in conference or after the basic course is done. This book has a lot of material. Enough for two semesters, and maybe more. It can be frustrating sometimes so be patient and find comfort in the fact that everyone probably struggles with this book early. Finally, I'll note that there are lots of potential topics for conference work!
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional Texts</h4>

Calculus with Complex Variables is a vast (and fun!) subject. There's lots of ways to teach it and lots of resources out there.<br>

<h4>What is this class?</h4>
<p>
Once described as "that amphibian between existence and nonexistence" by Leibniz, the so-called <it>complex numbers</it>, \(z=x+iy\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers and \(i=\sqrt{-1}\) is the <it>imaginary unit</it>, were met with suspicion and hostility for almost two and a half centuries.  These numbers have since proven to have a profound impact on the whole of mathematics. Once accepted, however, the development of a beautiful new theory of how to do calculus with such numbers was astonishingly rapid going from birth (in 1814) to maturity (in 1851) in less than 40 years! After this intense period of investigation, any lingering suspicions held by the scientific community over the reality of complex numbers were subsequently squashed due to the amazing utility of this ``new calculus'' in mathematics, physics, engineering, and elsewhere. 
</br></br> 

We'll learn the meaning of complex multiplication, exponentiation, as in Euler's famous equation 
\(e^{i\pi}= -1\), and the associated geometry of these numbers. We'll study complex functions and their power series, and learn the many deep properties of M\"{o}bius transformations. We'll explore differentiation of complex functions and learn how to integrate them in the complex plane. We'll see the easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which says that every algebraic equation has a solution as long as you allow complex numbers. Numerous applications to other fields of mathematics (such as number theory or non-euclidean geometry), physics, and engineering can also be explored in seminar and in conference work according to the tastes and wishes of the students.
