<a name="policies"></a><h2>Course Policies</h2>

<p><h4>Introduction</h4>
This course is an introduction to the basic ideas of differentiation and
integration of functions, as well as the interplay between these concepts. The course will also
solidify and expand your algebra skills, and should clarify and deepen your understanding
of trigonometry, exponentiation, and logarithms. Math 141 is designed for students with
no prior Calculus experience, though in practice some students in the course may have seen
some calculus in their last year of high school.
</p>

<p><h4>Prerequisites</h4>
You must have a solid foundation in algebra and geometry, as well as some familiarity with trigonometry and logarithms. Please come talk to me if you are unsure whether this is the right course for you.

<p><h4>Computational Problems &amp; Quizzes</h4>
Computation is an important component of mathematics, and is a key part of any calculus course.  I will often recommend practice problems from the textbook, and you are strongly advised to try at least some of these problems.  To make sure your computational skills are progressing, there will be a short (10&ndash;15 minute) quiz each Tuesday consisting of a few relatively straightforward problems.

<p><h4>Written Homework</h4>
There will be a weekly homework assignment consisting of a few longer problems, with an emphasis on the conceptual side of calculus.  You are encouraged to work with other students in solving the homework problems, but you should write your own solutions, and you must acknowledge anyone that you work with.  Your solutions should be written clearly and in complete sentences, with enough detail that another student in the class would be able to follow your reasoning.

<p><h4>Exams and Grading</h4>
The grade will be based on the written homework assignments, the in-class quizzes, and three exams:</p>
<div align=center>
<table class="grid">
<tr><td class="box">Exam 1</td> <td class="box">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Exam 2</td> <td class="box">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Final Exam</td> <td class="box">25%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Written Homework</td> <td class="box">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="box">Quizzes</td> <td class="box">15%</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The exams are two hours long, and are tentatively scheduled for March&nbsp;1, April&nbsp;12, and May 21.  The first two exams are on <b>Fridays</b>, and you can take the exam any time that day.

<p><h4>Textbook</h4>
The textbook is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Single-Variable-Calculus-Concepts-Contexts/dp/0495560642"</a><i>Single Variable Calculus: Concepts and Contexts, 4th&nbsp;ed.</i></a>, by James Stewart.  We will cover most of the material in Chapters 1&ndash;4, as well as the first half of Chapter&nbsp;5.  You should read the relevant section of the text <i>before</i> we cover the material in class, and then again while doing the homework.</p>

<p><h4>Calculator</h4>
You will need a graphing calculator such as a Texas Instruments TI&ndash;83 or TI&ndash;84.
